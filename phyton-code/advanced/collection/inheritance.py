Benefits of inheritance are:
Inheritance allows you to inherit the properties of a class, i.e., base class to another, i.e., derived class.
The benefits of Inheritance in Python are as follows:

It represents real-world relationships well.
It provides the reusability of a code. We donâ€™t have to write the same code again and again. Also, it allows us to add more features to a class without modifying it.
It is transitive in nature, which means that if class B inherits from another class A, then all the subclasses of B would automatically inherit from class A.
Inheritance offers a simple, understandable model structure.
Less development and maintenance expenses result from an inheritance.

Syntax:
Class BaseClass:
    {Body}
Class DerivedClass(BaseClass):
    {Body}
