"""
How does reduce() and filter() work in Python?

filter(): Filters elements from an iterable based on a function.
reduce(): Applies a function to the items of an iterable, cumulatively,
from left to right, so as to reduce the iterable to a single value.
Both functions are part of Pythonâ€™s functools module (Python 3.x) and
can be used together to filter and then reduce data if needed.
