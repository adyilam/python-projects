"""
Encapsulation is one of the fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP).
It describes the idea of wrapping data and the methods that work on data within one unit.
This puts restrictions on accessing variables and methods directly and can prevent the accidental modification of data.

Encapsulation:
Definition: The bundling of data and methods that operate on the data into a single unit, with controlled access to the internal state.
Purpose: To protect an objectâ€™s internal state and expose a controlled interface.
Implementation: Achieved through private and protected members.

Abstraction:
Definition: The concept of hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object.
Purpose: To simplify interaction with objects by focusing on high-level operations rather than implementation details.
Implementation: Achieved through abstract classes and methods, interfaces, and high-level class design.
