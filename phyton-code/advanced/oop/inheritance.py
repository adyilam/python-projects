Benefits of inheritance are:

Inheritance allows you to inherit the properties of a class, i.e., base class to another,
i.e., derived class. The benefits of Inheritance in Python are as follows:

- It represents real-world relationships well.
- It provides the reusability of a code. We donâ€™t have to write the same code again and again. Also,
- It allows us to add more features to a class without modifying it.
- It is transitive in nature, which means that if class B inherits from another class A, then all
  the subclasses of B would automatically inherit from class A.
- Inheritance offers a simple, understandable model structure.
- Less development and maintenance expenses result from an inheritance.

Python Inheritance Syntax:
The syntax of simple inheritance in Python is as follows:

Class BaseClass:
    {Body}
Class DerivedClass(BaseClass):
    {Body}
